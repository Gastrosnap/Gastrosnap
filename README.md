BYI !!

I've been emotionally nd mentally abused/manipulated throughout majority of my life, as well as being s/a'd various times nd its made me rather sensitive nd irritable. 

I display * SOME * symptoms of DID nd PTSD, I am NOT self diagnosing, nor am I actually diagnosed, but please keep that in mind.

Please try to be patient with me, m tryin to get better, but I haven't been makin much progress as of now. 


Try to use tone tags with me when you're joking around (unless we're close friends), mostly because of how sensitive I can get sometimes, but also for comfort reasons.


You can always cuddle with me, I won't mind the company!
